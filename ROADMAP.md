## 0. What we are building (scope)

A two-part product initiative that makes ARA's methodological expertise **visible,
standardized, and sellable** — without becoming a software company:

1. **Report Library** — a small set of exemplar, decision-first sample reports, one per
   priority domain, that (a) prove what a client receives, (b) double as reusable delivery
   templates, and (c) become the destinations the Decision Lab points to.
2. **Research Decision Lab** — a *static* (client-side, no backend) diagnostic on
   `measuremeaning.com/lab`: 10–12 questions → recommended approach + methodological risks
   + deliverables + next step, with lead capture via Formspree.

**Market for v1:** US / M&M (English, USD). RF trademark/sociology practice is a separate
future "domain brain" on the same frame — deferred.

## 1. Standing rules (non-negotiable)

- Never name KPMG — refer only to "a top-5 global consulting firm."
- No fabricated clients, metrics, testimonials, or photography-as-team/client.
- Every sample labeled **illustrative + synthetic**; fictional org names only.
- MVP is **fully static** — no backend, no monthly cost. Leads via Formspree.
- The "one input → many internal documents" (proposal engine) is run **by the principal**
  in Claude (Cowork/Code), not by a server-side API. Principal-led judgment.
- IP tiering for instruments: **A** = own/official (original synthesis) · **B** = public/
  academic (paraphrase, attribute, check each) · **C** = proprietary vendor (never copied).
- Ambiguous factual claims → flag for owner sign-off, don't change unilaterally.
- Anonymity threshold in employee work: no breakout for a group of N < 5.

## 2. Phase plan

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | Decisions: market, build order, static MVP, rules | ✅ Done |
| **1** | **Report Library** — exemplar sample reports per domain (Employee → CX/Patient → Brand/Market) + turn each into an automation-ready `{{braces}}` template in the repo | 🟡 In progress |
| **2** | **Decision Lab MVP** — static 10–12-Q diagnostic on /lab; rule-based routing from skills; Formspree; client-side PDF | ⬜ Not started |
| **3** | **Internal Proposal Engine** — principal-run Claude workflow: brief → lead summary, discovery agenda, risk memo, service rec, proposal draft | ⬜ Not started |
| **4** | **Survey Quality Checker** — internal first (from skills); public shows 3–5 flags; full audit paid | ⬜ Not started |
| **5** | **Defer:** backend (Supabase/CRM/Stripe), client portal, RF branch (152-ФЗ + OFAC gating) | ⏸ Deferred |

## 3. Report Library tracker (Phase 1 detail)

Shared skeleton across domains: Executive summary (decision-first) → Objectives →
Method (brief) → Sample & coverage → Results by objective → **Driver analysis (the
differentiator)** → Recommended actions → Limitations → Appendix (instrument provenance).

| Domain | Sample report (.docx) | Automation template in repo | Website "what you receive" |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Employee / HR** | ✅ v1 built (`Employee_Engagement_Retention_SAMPLE.docx`) — eNPS, satisfaction, burnout by segment, PsyCap, values, stay-vs-leave driver model | ⬜ next candidate (A) | ⬜ |
| **CX / Patient** | ⬜ (top-box, coordination-of-care, CAHPS-style) | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| **Brand / Market** | ⬜ (awareness, associations, share) | ⬜ | ⬜ |

Repo anchors: `skills/domain-hr-employee/`, `skills/survey-reporting/references/report-structure.md`,
`skills/domain-legal/references/report-template.md` (pattern for the `{{braces}}` automation).

## 4. Decisions log

- **2026-07-15** Market for v1 Lab = **US / M&M**.
- **2026-07-15** Build order = **Report Library first**, then Decision Lab.
- **2026-07-15** Priority domains = **Employee, CX/Patient, Brand/Market**.
- **2026-07-15** MVP = **fully static**, leads via Formspree, no backend.
- **2026-07-15** Standing content rules confirmed apply to all report templates.
- **2026-07-15** Employee sample report v1 produced (fully synthetic, labeled illustrative).

---

## 5. Open decisions (waiting on owner)

1. **Real vs. synthetic data for report templates.** Default = synthetic. If anonymizable
   real outputs exist (e.g. the Engage motivation report), prepare a working template
   variant on that basis. → *pending answer.*
2. **Next step:** (A) turn Employee sample into an automation-ready repo template, or
   (B) build the next domain sample (CX/Patient or Brand/Market). → *pending answer.*

---

## 6. How we work (per-session ritual)

1. Start a **new chat per single task** (one report, or one template) — long threads get
   expensive; split work across sessions.
2. Open the session by pointing Claude at this ROADMAP ("работаем по ROADMAP, фаза X"),
   or let Claude fetch it from the repo.
3. Do the one focused chunk.
4. Claude ends with a **STATUS block** (Done / Next / Open decisions) → paste it into this
   file's Decisions/Status and, optionally, commit to the repo.

## 7. STATUS (latest)

- **Done:** Phase 0 decisions; Employee Engagement & Retention sample report v1 (9-page
  .docx, decision-first, PsyCap + stay-vs-leave driver model, illustrative/synthetic).
- **Next:** owner to choose (A) automate Employee template in repo, or (B) next domain
  sample; and confirm synthetic vs. real-data variant.
- **Open:** the two decisions in §5.
